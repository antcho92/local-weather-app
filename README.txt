A local weather app created for a Free Code Camp project. It shows your local weather based off your geolocation. The weather icon changes based on the description of the weather.

It was made using jQuery and the Open Weather Map API. It uses AJAX to update your local weather using the geolocation API.

This app will not work in Chrome because they do not allow the geolocation API to work on unsecured connections. Tested to work on Firefox browser.
